Setup and importing data from mongo db: create the configuation/monogo_db_connection file,this file will setup the monog db client and connection. Then write the data_acess/sensor_data.py. This will be used for importing the data from mongodb to feature store during the data_ingestion process.
data ingestion: After setting up the connection and specifying the constants such as database name and collection name in constant/triaining_pipeline.py we will prepare the acceptable configuration of the data_ingestion components and the artifact, this should be done in entity/config_entity and entity/aritfact/entity. Now we are ready to Write the data_ingestion component in the components/data_ingestion.py. To use this component we will import it inside the pipeline/training_pipeline. 
Data_validation: Write down the constants such as Directory and file names and then specify the Configuration in entity/config_entity adn then entity/artifact_entity. Finally write down all the stages of component and import it inside the Training pipeline to use it.
